# Demo Workflow Engine 🚀

A **naive implementation** of a simple workflow engine created just for fun 🎉. This engine helps automate and manage tasks in a sequential or conditional flow 🎯. 

You can define workflows with customizable nodes, including conditions, increments, and responses. Plus, you can extend the engine by building your own **custom Nodes** and **Triggers** to tailor it to your needs 🔧✨.

## Features 🔥
- Basic task sequencing 📝
- Condition handling (if/switch) 🛠️
- Extendable with custom Nodes and Triggers 🔄

## Installation 💻

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Start building your workflow!

## TODO 🚧
- Add support for **Abort Controller** 🛑
- Add support for **timeouts** (for each Node and for the entire Workflow) ⏲️
- Improve **error handling** 💥
- More **tests** 🧪
- Add more **examples** and **Nodes** 🌱
